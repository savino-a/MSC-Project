## First Talk (Sergey Bravyi (IBM))
**Advantage of quantum computation vs. classical computation**

Idea of deep/shallow circuit
- Recursive QAOA (RQAOA):
  - Remove some of the nodes
  - Better than QAOA bc global solving view, not local

**Look at that for project, surpassing the problem of local maxs**

## Second Talk (Enrique Rico)
More about quantum physics...

## Third Talk (Sofia Vallecorsa)
**Symmetry breaking in geometric quantum machine learning in the presence of noise**
